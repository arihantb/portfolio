## [Problem Statement](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum)

## Solution

We keep the numbers in the hash table and then for each number $num$, check if number $target−num$ is also in the hash table.

This is some multiline latex:

$$
T(n) = 2 * T(n - 2) + \theta(n)
$$

Single line `code` variables `are` there.

## Complexity

- Time: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the $nums$
- Space: $O(n)$

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: # this is some commented out line but this line is very long
        hashmap = {}

        for index, num in enumerate(nums):
            if target - num in hashmap:
                return [hashmap[target - num], index]

            hashmap[num] = index
```
